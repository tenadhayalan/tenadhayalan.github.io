title: "Liver Glycogen as a Sensitive Indicator of Food Limitation in Delta Smelt"
collection: publications
category: manuscripts
permalink: /publication/2023-Liver-Glycogen
excerpt: 'This paper is part of a broader project investigating measures of food limitation in Delta Smelt, a long proposed cause for their difficult recovery. Here, I focused on optimizing a method for the determination of liver glycogen in small amounts of fish tissue. We then applied this method to wild-caught Delta Smelt to conclude that glycogen levels of wild fish were more similar to unfed hatchery fish than fed hatchery fish. This work informs the broader environmental context in which Delta Smelt are struggling to recover, and provides a framework for conservationists to access suitability of hatchery-release habitats.'
