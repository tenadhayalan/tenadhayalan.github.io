About me
======
Hi! I am a marine ecophysiologist studying rocky intertidal invertebrates in the face of climate change. I received my Animal Biology B.S. from UC Davis, where I worked on conservation efforts for the endangered Delta Smelt. I conducted my senior thesis on the effects of biocontrol agents on estuarine fishes such as Delta Smelt and Rainbow Trout. I also conducted a research project investigating the commensal relationship between bat stars and the worms living under them. I just recently defended my Master's thesis at California State University, Northridge focusing on the effects of acidification and warming on predator-prey interactions in the intertidal.
